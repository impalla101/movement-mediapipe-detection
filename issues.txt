## Current Issues

- App stuck at splash screen due to requested permission waiting
for approval. Permission does not appear "on top" of the app.
This requires a fix to move it to the front to allow user to choose Allow.


- App crash. After running successfully for 5-7 minutes the app crashed.

Error log: "The app “movement” has been killed by the operating system because it is using too much memory.
Domain: IDEDebugSessionErrorDomain
Code: 11
Recovery Suggestion: Use a memory profiling tool to track the process memory usage.
